## Add our human model in Gazebo models directory

You can add our human model created with [Makehuman](http://www.makehumancommunity.org/) to your model directory in Gazebo as follows:
- Copy the [Human](../master/utils/Gazebo-Human_Model/Human/) directory that contains the files for the model and its settings into the Gazebo models directory. You can access the Gazebo models directory as follows:
```sh
~$ cd ~/.gazebo
~/.gazebo$ nautilus models
```
- After opening the file explorer in the Gazebo models directory, copy the Human directory. Verify in Gazebo that the model was added correctly
