## Download RGB-D dataset

To simulate the plc detector, using an RGB-D image dataset it is necessary to download the dataset previously. For the simulation with a dataset, we make use of the EPFL-LAB dataset, [here](../master/utils/dataset/README.md) you can see where to download it.

## Convert depth images to point cloud

To convert the images of the data set in the point cloud, a function was used, which was taken from [here](https://github.com/ZJULiXiaoyang/depth2pointCloud).
